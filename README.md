# Scavenger-Ressuplier---IW5
The Scavenger perk feature from Cod: Mw2 (2009) returns to Cod: Mw3 (2011).

In Cod: Mw3, using Scavenger adds ammo to primary and secondary weapons (except for rocket launchers), but lethal and tactical grenades will not be added when picking up a bag with Scavenger, unlike in Cod: Mw2 where picking up a Scavenger bag also replenishes the grenades. Therefore, this .gsc file adds a feature to Cod: Mw3 multiplayer so that picking up a Scavenger bag will not only replenish weapon ammo, but also replenish both lethal and tactical grenades, even rocket launchers.
